TI  - Super-enhancer hypermutation alters oncogene expression in B cell
      lymphoma.
PG  - 808-815

AB  - Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B cell non-
      Hodgkin lymphoma and remains incurable in around 40% of patients. Efforts
      to sequence the coding genome identified several genes and pathways that
      are altered in this disease, including potential therapeutic
      targets(1-5). However, the non-coding genome of DLBCL remains largely
      unexplored. Here we show that active super-enhancers are highly and
      specifically hypermutated in 92% of samples from individuals with DLBCL,
      display signatures of activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity, and
      are linked to genes that encode B cell developmental regulators and
      oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we show that the
      hypermutated super-enhancers linked to the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 proto-
      oncogenes prevent the binding and transcriptional downregulation of the
      corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1
      (targeting BCL6) and the steroid receptor NR3C1 (targeting BCL2 and
      CXCR4). Genetic correction of selected mutations restored repressor DNA
      binding, downregulated target gene expression and led to the counter-
      selection of cells containing corrected alleles, indicating an oncogenic
      dependency on the super-enhancer mutations. This pervasive super-enhancer
      mutational mechanism reveals a major set of genetic lesions deregulating
      gene expression, which expands the involvement of known oncogenes in
      DLBCL pathogenesis and identifies new deregulated gene targets of
      therapeutic relevance.

TI  - Tracking Immunoglobulin Repertoire and Transcriptomic Changes in Germinal
      Center B Cells by Single-Cell Analysis.
PG  - 818758
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.818758 [doi]
AB  - In response to T-cell-dependent antigens, mature B cells in the secondary
      lymphoid organs are stimulated to form germinal centers (GCs), which are
      histological structures deputed to antibody affinity maturation, a
      process associated with immunoglobulin gene editing by somatic
      hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). GC B cells are
      heterogeneous and transition across multiple stages before being
      eliminated by apoptosis or committing to post-GC differentiation as
      memory B cells or plasma cells. In order to explore the dynamics of SHM
      and CSR during the GC reaction, we identified GC subpopulations by
      single-cell (sc) transcriptomics and analyzed the load of immunoglobulin
      variable (V) region mutations as well as the isotype class distribution
      in each subpopulation. The results showed that the large majority of GC B
      cells display a quantitatively similar mutational load in the V regions
      and analogous IGH isotype class distribution, except for the precursors
      of memory B cells (PreM) and plasma cells (PBL). PreM showed a bimodal
      pattern with about half of the cells displaying high V region germline
      identity and enrichment for unswitched IGH, while the rest of the cells
      carried a mutational load similar to the bulk of GC B cells and showed a
      switched isotype. PBL displayed a bias toward expression of IGHG and
      higher V region germline identity compared to the bulk of GC B cells.
      Genes implicated in SHM and CSR were significantly induced in specific GC
      subpopulations, consistent with the occurrence of SHM in dark zone cells
      and suggesting that CSR can occur within the GC.

TI  - Mutations in the transcription factor FOXO1 mimic positive selection
      signals to promote germinal center B cell expansion and lymphomagenesis.

AB  - The transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), which instructs the
      dark zone program to direct germinal center (GC) polarity, is typically
      inactivated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signals. Here, we
      investigated how FOXO1 mutations targeting this regulatory axis in GC-
      derived B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHLs) contribute to
      lymphomagenesis. Examination of primary B-NHL tissues revealed that FOXO1
      mutations and PI3K pathway activity were not directly correlated. Human B
      cell lines bearing FOXO1 mutations exhibited hyperactivation of PI3K and
      Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)
      signaling, and increased cell survival under stress conditions as a
      result of alterations in FOXO1 transcriptional affinities and activation
      of transcriptional programs characteristic of GC-positive selection. When
      modeled in mice, FOXO1 mutations conferred competitive advantage to B
      cells in response to key T-dependent immune signals, disrupting GC
      homeostasis. FOXO1 mutant transcriptional signatures were prevalent in
      human B-NHL and predicted poor clinical outcomes. Thus, rather than
      enforcing FOXO1 constitutive activity, FOXO1 mutations enable co-option
      of GC-positive selection programs during the pathogenesis of GC-derived
      lymphomas.

AB  - In response to T cell-dependent antigens, mature B cells are stimulated
      to form germinal centers (GCs), the sites of B cell affinity maturation
      and the cell of origin (COO) of most B cell lymphomas. To explore the
      dynamics of GC B cell development beyond the known dark zone and light
      zone compartments, we performed single-cell (sc) transcriptomic analysis
      on human GC B cells and identified multiple functionally linked
      subpopulations, including the distinct precursors of memory B cells and
      plasma cells. The gene expression signatures associated with these GC
      subpopulations were effective in providing a sc-COO for approximately 80%
      of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and identified novel
      prognostic subgroups of DLBCL.

      Acetyltransferases in Germinal Center B Cells Reveal Targetable
      Dependencies in Lymphoma.

AB  - Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP and EP300 acetyltransferases are
      among the most common genetic alterations in diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). Here, we examined the
      relationship between these two enzymes in germinal center (GC) B cells,
      the normal counterpart of FL and DLBCL, and in lymphomagenesis by using
      conditional GC-directed deletion mouse models targeting Crebbp or Ep300.
      We found that CREBBP and EP300 modulate common as well as distinct
      transcriptional programs implicated in separate anatomic and functional
      GC compartments. Consistently, deletion of Ep300 but not Crebbp impaired
      the fitness of GC B cells in vivo. Combined loss of Crebbp and Ep300
      completely abrogated GC formation, suggesting that these proteins
      partially compensate for each other through common transcriptional
      targets. This synthetic lethal interaction was retained in CREBBP-mutant
      DLBCL cells and could be pharmacologically targeted with selective small
      molecule inhibitors of CREBBP and EP300 function. These data provide
      proof-of-principle for the clinical development of EP300-specific
      inhibitors in FL and DLBCL.

AB  - The gene encoding the MEF2B transcription factor is mutated in germinal
      center (GC)-derived B cell lymphomas, but its role in GC development and
      lymphomagenesis is unknown. We demonstrate that Mef2b deletion reduces GC
      formation in mice and identify MEF2B transcriptional targets in GC, with
      roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, GC confinement, and
      differentiation. The most common lymphoma-associated MEF2B mutant
      (MEF2B(D83V)) is hypomorphic, yet escapes binding and negative regulation
      by components of the HUCA complex and class IIa HDACs. Mef2b(D83V)
      expression in mice leads to GC enlargement and lymphoma development, a
      phenotype that becomes fully penetrant in combination with BCL2 de-
      regulation, an event associated with human MEF2B mutations. These results
      identify MEF2B as a critical GC regulator and a driver oncogene in
      lymphomagenesis.

PG  - E2911-E2919
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1702564114 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations of NOTCH1 (a well-known oncogene in T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia) are present in approximately 4-13% of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases, where they are associated with disease
      progression and chemorefractoriness. However, the specific role of NOTCH1
      in leukemogenesis remains to be established. Here, we report that the
      active intracellular portion of NOTCH1 (ICN1) is detectable in
      approximately 50% of peripheral blood CLL cases lacking gene mutations.
      We identify a "NOTCH1 gene-expression signature" in CLL cells, and show
      that this signature is significantly enriched in primary CLL cases
      expressing ICN1, independent of NOTCH1 mutation. NOTCH1 target genes
      include key regulators of B-cell proliferation, survival, and signal
      transduction. In particular, we show that NOTCH1 transactivates MYC via
      binding to B-cell-specific regulatory elements, thus implicating this
      oncogene in CLL development. These results significantly extend the role
      of NOTCH1 in CLL pathogenesis, and have direct implications for specific
      therapeutic targeting.

TI  - The CREBBP Acetyltransferase Is a Haploinsufficient Tumor Suppressor in
      B-cell Lymphoma.

AB  - Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP acetyltransferase are highly
      frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma
      (FL), the two most common germinal center (GC)-derived cancers. However,
      the role of CREBBP inactivation in lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here,
      we show that CREBBP regulates enhancer/super-enhancer networks with
      central roles in GC/post-GC cell fate decisions, including genes involved
      in signal transduction by the B-cell receptor and CD40 receptor,
      transcriptional control of GC and plasma cell development, and antigen
      presentation. Consistently, Crebbp-deficient B cells exhibit enhanced
      response to mitogenic stimuli and perturbed plasma cell differentiation.
      Although GC-specific loss of Crebbp was insufficient to initiate
      malignant transformation, compound Crebbp-
      haploinsufficient/BCL2-transgenic mice, mimicking the genetics of FL and
      DLBCL, develop clonal lymphomas recapitulating the features of the human
      diseases. These findings establish CREBBP as a haploinsufficient tumor-
      suppressor gene in GC B cells and provide insights into the mechanisms by
      which its loss contributes to lymphomagenesis.Significance: Loss-of-
      function mutations of CREBBP are common and early lesions in FL and
      DLBCL, suggesting a prominent role in lymphoma initiation. Our studies
      identify the cellular program by which reduced CREBBP dosage facilitates
      malignant transformation, and have direct implications for targeted
      lymphoma therapy based on drugs affecting CREBBP-mediated chromatin
      acetylation. Cancer Discov; 7(3); 322-37. (c)2017 AACR.This article is

TI  - The genetics of nodal marginal zone lymphoma.
PG  - 1362-73
LID - 10.1182/blood-2016-02-696757 [doi]
AB  - Nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) is a rare, indolent B-cell tumor that
      is distinguished from splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) by the
      different pattern of dissemination. NMZL still lacks distinct markers and
      remains orphan of specific cancer gene lesions. By combining whole-exome
      sequencing, targeted sequencing of tumor-related genes, whole-
      transcriptome sequencing, and high-resolution single nucleotide
      polymorphism array analysis, we aimed at disclosing the pathways that are
      molecularly deregulated in NMZL and we compare the molecular profile of
      NMZL with that of SMZL. These analyses identified a distinctive pattern
      of nonsilent somatic lesions in NMZL. In 35 NMZL patients, 41 genes were
      found recurrently affected in >/=3 (9%) cases, including highly prevalent
      molecular lesions of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D; 34%), PTPRD (20%), NOTCH2
      (20%), and KLF2 (17%). Mutations of PTPRD, a receptor-type protein
      tyrosine phosphatase regulating cell growth, were enriched in NMZL across
      mature B-cell tumors, functionally caused the loss of the phosphatase
      activity of PTPRD, and were associated with cell-cycle transcriptional
      program deregulation and increased proliferation index in NMZL. Although
      NMZL shared with SMZL a common mutation profile, NMZL harbored PTPRD
      lesions that were otherwise absent in SMZL. Collectively, these findings
      provide new insights into the genetics of NMZL, identify PTPRD lesions as
      a novel marker for this lymphoma across mature B-cell tumors, and support
      the distinction of NMZL as an independent clinicopathologic entity within
      the current lymphoma classification.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.7356 [doi]
AB  - To shed light into the molecular bases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia lacking known fusion transcripts, i.e. BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1,
      E2A-PBX1, and MLL rearrangements (B-NEG ALL) and the differences between
      children, adolescents/young adults (AYA) and adults, we analyzed 168
      B-NEG ALLs by genome-wide technologies. This approach showed that B-NEG
      cases carry 10.5 mutations and 9.1 copy-number aberrations/sample. The
      most frequently mutated druggable pathways were those pertaining to
      RAS/RTK (26.8%) and JAK/STAT (12.5%) signaling. In particular, FLT3 and
      JAK/STAT mutations were detected mainly in AYA and adults, while KRAS and
      NRAS mutations were more frequent in children. RAS/RTK mutations
      negatively affected the outcome of AYA and adults, but not that of
      children. Furthermore, adult B-NEG ALL carrying JAK/STAT mutations had a
      shorter survival. In vitro experiments showed that FLT3 inhibitors
      reduced significantly the proliferation of FLT3-mutated primary B-NEG ALL
      cells. Likewise, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors reduced the proliferation of
      primary cells harboring RAS and IL7R mutations. These results refine the
      genetic landscape of B-NEG ALL and suggest that the different
      distribution of lesions and their prognostic impact might sustain the
      diverse outcome between children, adults and partly AYA - whose genomic
      scenario is similar to adults - and open the way to targeted therapeutic
      strategies.

AB  - The pathways regulating formation of the germinal center (GC) dark zone
      (DZ) and light zone (LZ) are unknown. In this study we show that FOXO1
      transcription factor expression was restricted to the GC DZ and was
      required for DZ formation, since its absence in mice led to the loss of
      DZ gene programs and the formation of LZ-only GCs. FOXO1-negative GC B
      cells displayed normal somatic hypermutation but defective affinity
      maturation and class switch recombination. The function of FOXO1 in
      sustaining the DZ program involved the trans-activation of the chemokine
      receptor CXCR4, and cooperation with the BCL6 transcription factor in the
      trans-repression of genes involved in immune activation, DNA repair, and
      plasma cell differentiation. These results also have implications for the
      role of FOXO1 in lymphomagenesis because they suggest that constitutive
      FOXO1 activity might be required for the oncogenic activity of
      deregulated BCL6 expression.

TI  - Disruption of KMT2D perturbs germinal center B cell development and
      promotes lymphomagenesis.
PG  - 1190-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.3940 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the gene encoding the KMT2D (or MLL2) methyltransferase are
      highly recurrent and occur early during tumorigenesis in diffuse large B
      cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). However, the
      functional consequences of these mutations and their role in
      lymphomagenesis are unknown. Here we show that FL- and DLBCL-associated
      KMT2D mutations impair KMT2D enzymatic activity, leading to diminished
      global H3K4 methylation in germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL cells.
      Conditional deletion of Kmt2d early during B cell development, but not
      after initiation of the GC reaction, results in an increase in GC B cells
      and enhances B cell proliferation in mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of
      Kmt2d in mice overexpressing Bcl2 increases the incidence of GC-derived
      lymphomas resembling human tumors. These findings suggest that KMT2D acts
      as a tumor suppressor gene whose early loss facilitates lymphomagenesis
      by remodeling the epigenetic landscape of the cancer precursor cells.
      Eradication of KMT2D-deficient cells may thus represent a rational
      therapeutic approach for targeting early tumorigenic events.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1322466111 [doi]
AB  - Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (B-NHL), which originates from germinal center (GC) B cells and harbors
      translocations deregulating v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene
      homolog (MYC). A comparative analysis of microRNAs expressed in normal
      and malignant GC B cells identified microRNA 28 (miR-28) as significantly
      down-regulated in BL, as well as in other GC-derived B-NHL. We show that
      reexpression of miR-28 impairs cell proliferation and clonogenic
      properties of BL cells by modulating several targets including MAD2
      mitotic arrest deficient-like 1, MAD2L1, a component of the spindle
      checkpoint whose down-regulation is essential in mediating miR-28-induced
      proliferation arrest, and BCL2-associated athanogene, BAG1, an activator
      of the ERK pathway. We identify the oncogene MYC as a negative regulator
      of miR-28 expression, suggesting that its deregulation by chromosomal
      translocation in BL leads to miR-28 suppression. In addition, we show
      that miR-28 can inhibit MYC-induced transformation by directly targeting
      genes up-regulated by MYC. Overall, our data suggest that miR-28 acts as
      a tumor suppressor in BL and that its repression by MYC contributes to
      B-cell lymphomagenesis.

AB  - Fludarabine refractoriness (FR) represents an unsolved clinical problem
      of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) management. Although next-
      generation sequencing studies have led to the identification of a number
      of genes frequently mutated in FR-CLL, a comprehensive evaluation of the
      FR-CLL genome has not been reported. Toward this end, we studied 10 FR-
      CLLs by combining whole-exome sequencing and copy number aberration (CNA)
      analysis, which showed an average of 16.3 somatic mutations and 4 CNAs
      per sample. Screening of recurrently mutated genes in 48 additional FR-
      CLLs revealed that ~70% of FR-CLLs carry >/=1 mutation in genes
      previously associated with CLL clinical course, including TP53 (27.5%),
      NOTCH1 (24.1%), SF3B1 (18.9%), and BIRC3 (15.5%). In addition, this
      analysis showed that 10.3% of FR-CLL cases display mutations of the FAT1
      gene, which encodes for a cadherin-like protein that negatively regulates
      Wnt signaling, consistent with a tumor suppressor role. The frequency of
      FAT1-mutated cases was significantly higher in FR-CLL than in unselected
      CLLs at diagnosis (10.3% vs 1.1%, P = .004), suggesting a role in the
      development of a high-risk phenotype. These findings have general
      implications for the mechanisms leading to FR and point to Wnt signaling
      as a potential therapeutic target in FR-CLL.

AB  - Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent disease, but 30%-40% of cases
      undergo histologic transformation to an aggressive malignancy, typically
      represented by diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The pathogenesis of
      this process remains largely unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing and
      copy-number analysis, we show here that the dominant clone of FL and
      transformed FL (tFL) arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated
      precursor through the acquisition of distinct genetic events. Mutations
      in epigenetic modifiers and antiapoptotic genes are introduced early in
      the common precursor, whereas tFL is specifically associated with
      alterations deregulating cell-cycle progression and DNA damage responses
      (CDKN2A/B, MYC, and TP53) as well as aberrant somatic hypermutation. The
      genomic profile of tFL shares similarities with that of germinal center B
      cell-type de novo DLBCL but also displays unique combinations of altered
      genes with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

TI  - Genetic lesions associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      transformation to Richter syndrome.
PG  - 2273-88
LID - 10.1084/jem.20131448 [doi]
AB  - Richter syndrome (RS) derives from the rare transformation of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly of
      the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. The molecular
      pathogenesis of RS is only partially understood. By combining whole-exome
      sequencing and copy-number analysis of 9 CLL-RS pairs and of an extended
      panel of 43 RS cases, we show that this aggressive disease typically
      arises from the predominant CLL clone by acquiring an average of
      approximately 20 genetic lesions/case. RS lesions are heterogeneous in
      terms of load and spectrum among patients, and include those involved in
      CLL progression and chemorefractoriness (TP53 disruption and NOTCH1
      activation) as well as some not previously implicated in CLL or RS
      pathogenesis. In particular, disruption of the CDKN2A/B cell cycle
      regulator is associated with approximately 30% of RS cases. Finally, we
      report that the genomic landscape of RS is significantly different from
      that of de novo DLBCL, suggesting that they represent distinct disease
      entities. These results provide insights into RS pathogenesis, and
      identify dysregulated pathways of potential diagnostic and therapeutic
      relevance.

      and is down-regulated in B cell lymphoma.
PG  - 1404-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1206761110 [doi]
AB  - Sequencing studies from several model systems have suggested that diverse
      and abundant small RNAs may be derived from tRNA, but the function of
      these molecules remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that one such
      tRNA-derived fragment, cloned from human mature B cells and designated
      CU1276, in fact possesses the functional characteristics of a microRNA,
      including a DICER1-dependent biogenesis, physical association with
      Argonaute proteins, and the ability to repress mRNA transcripts in a
      sequence-specific manner. Expression of CU1276 is abundant in normal
      germinal center B cells but absent in germinal center-derived lymphomas,
      suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore,
      CU1276 represses endogenous RPA1, an essential gene involved in many
      aspects of DNA dynamics, and consequently, expression of this tRNA-
      derived microRNA in a lymphoma cell line suppresses proliferation and
      modulates the molecular response to DNA damage. These results establish
      that functionally active microRNAs can be derived from tRNA, thus
      defining a class of genetic entities with potentially important
      biological roles.

TI  - BCL6 positively regulates AID and germinal center gene expression via
      repression of miR-155.
PG  - 2455-65
LID - 10.1084/jem.20121387 [doi]
AB  - The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is
      required for germinal center (GC) formation and whose de-regulation is
      involved in lymphomagenesis. Although substantial evidence indicates that
      BCL6 exerts its function by repressing the transcription of hundreds of
      protein-coding genes, its potential role in regulating gene expression
      via microRNAs (miRNAs) is not known. We have identified a core of 15
      miRNAs that show binding of BCL6 in their genomic loci and are down-
      regulated in GC B cells. Among BCL6 validated targets, miR-155 and
      miR-361 directly modulate AID expression, indicating that via repression
      of these miRNAs, BCL6 up-regulates AID. Similarly, the expression of
      additional genes relevant for the GC phenotype, including SPI1, IRF8, and
      MYB, appears to be sustained via BCL6-mediated repression of miR-155.
      These findings identify a novel mechanism by which BCL6, in addition to
      repressing protein coding genes, promotes the expression of important GC
      functions by repressing specific miRNAs.

TI  - Identification of human germinal center light and dark zone cells and
      their relationship to human B-cell lymphomas.

AB  - Germinal centers (GCs) are sites of B-cell clonal expansion,
      hypermutation, and selection. GCs are polarized into dark (DZ) and light
      zones (LZ), a distinction that is of key importance to GC selection.
      However, the difference between the B cells in each of these zones in
      humans remains unclear. We show that, as in mice, CXCR4 and CD83 can be
      used to distinguish human LZ and DZ cells. Using these markers, we show
      that LZ and DZ cells in mice and humans differ only in the expression of
      characteristic "activation" and "proliferation" programs, suggesting that
      these populations represent alternating states of a single-cell type
      rather than distinct differentiation stages. In addition, LZ/DZ
      transcriptional profiling shows that, with the exception of "molecular"
      Burkitt lymphomas, nearly all human B-cell malignancies closely resemble
      LZ cells, which has important implications for our understanding of the
      molecular programs of lymphomagenesis.

TI  - Combined genetic inactivation of beta2-Microglobulin and CD58 reveals
      frequent escape from immune recognition in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
PG  - 728-40
LID - 10.1016/j.ccr.2011.11.006 [doi]
AB  - We report that diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) commonly fails to
      express cell-surface molecules necessary for the recognition of tumor
      cells by immune-effector cells. In 29% of cases, mutations and deletions
      inactivate the beta2-Microglobulin gene, thus preventing the cell-surface
      expression of the HLA class-I (HLA-I) complex that is necessary for
      recognition by CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells. In 21% of cases, analogous
      lesions involve the CD58 gene, which encodes a molecule involved in T and
      natural killer cell-mediated responses. In addition to gene inactivation,
      alternative mechanisms lead to aberrant expression of HLA-I and CD58 in
      >60% of DLBCL. These two events are significantly associated in this
      disease, suggesting that they are coselected during lymphomagenesis for
      their combined role in escape from immune-surveillance.

TI  - Whole-exome sequencing identifies somatic mutations of BCOR in acute
      myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype.
PG  - 6153-63
LID - 10.1182/blood-2011-07-365320 [doi]
AB  - Among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a normal karyotype (CN-
      AML), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations define World Health Organization 2008
      provisional entities accounting for approximately 60% of patients, but
      the remaining 40% are molecularly poorly characterized. Using whole-exome
      sequencing of one CN-AML patient lacking mutations in NPM1, CEBPA,
      FLT3-ITD, IDH1, and MLL-PTD, we newly identified a clonal somatic
      mutation in BCOR (BCL6 corepressor), a gene located on chromosome Xp11.4.
      Further analyses of 553 AML patients showed that BCOR mutations occurred
      in 3.8% of unselected CN-AML patients and represented a substantial
      fraction (17.1%) of CN-AML patients showing the same genotype as the AML
      index patient subjected to whole-exome sequencing. BCOR somatic mutations
      were: (1) disruptive events similar to the germline BCOR mutations
      causing the oculo-facio-cardio-dental genetic syndrome; (2) associated
      with decreased BCOR mRNA levels, absence of full-length BCOR, and absent
      or low expression of a truncated BCOR protein; (3) virtually mutually
      exclusive with NPM1 mutations; and (4) frequently associated with DNMT3A
      mutations, suggesting cooperativity among these genetic alterations.
      Finally, BCOR mutations tended to be associated with an inferior outcome
      in a cohort of 422 CN-AML patients (25.6% vs 56.7% overall survival at 2
      years; P = .032). Our results for the first time implicate BCOR in CN-AML
      pathogenesis.

AB  - DNA polymerase gamma is a family A DNA polymerase responsible for the
      replication of mitochondrial DNA in eukaryotes. The origins of DNA
      polymerase gamma have remained elusive because it is not present in any
      known bacterium, though it has been hypothesized that mitochondria may
      have inherited the enzyme by phage-mediated nonorthologous displacement.
      Here, we present an analysis of two full-length homologues of this gene,
      which were found in the genomes of two bacteriophages, which infect the
      chlorophyll-d containing cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina.
      Phylogenetic analyses of these phage DNA polymerase gamma proteins show
      that they branch deeply within the DNA polymerase gamma clade and
      therefore share a common origin with their eukaryotic homologues. We also
      found homologues of these phage polymerases in the environmental
      Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Microbial Ecology Research and
      Analysis (CAMERA) database, which fell in the same clade. An analysis of
      the CAMERA assemblies containing the environmental homologues together
      with the filter fraction metadata indicated some of these assemblies may
      be of bacterial origin. We also show that the phage-encoded DNA
      polymerase gamma is highly transcribed as the phage genomes are
      replicated. These findings provide data that may assist in reconstructing
      the evolution of mitochondria.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0021132 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health record (EHR) systems offer an exceptional opportunity
      for studying many diseases and their associated medical conditions within
      a population. The increasing number of clinical record entries that have
      become available electronically provides access to rich, large sets of
      patients' longitudinal medical information. By integrating and comparing
      relations found in the EHRs with those already reported in the
      literature, we are able to verify existing and to identify rare or novel
      associations. Of particular interest is the identification of rare
      disease co-morbidities, where the small numbers of diagnosed patients
      make robust statistical analysis difficult. Here, we introduce ADAMS, an
      Application for Discovering Disease Associations using Multiple Sources,
      which contains various statistical and language processing operations. We
      apply ADAMS to the New York-Presbyterian Hospital's EHR to combine the
      information from the relational diagnosis tables and textual discharge
      summaries with those from PubMed and Wikipedia in order to investigate
      the co-morbidities of the rare diseases Kaposi sarcoma, toxoplasmosis,
      and Kawasaki disease. In addition to finding well-known characteristics
      of diseases, ADAMS can identify rare or previously unreported
      associations. In particular, we report a statistically significant
      association between Kawasaki disease and diagnosis of autistic disorder.

TI  - BRAF mutations in hairy-cell leukemia.
PG  - 2305-15
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1014209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) is a well-defined
      clinicopathological entity whose underlying genetic lesion is still
      obscure. METHODS: We searched for HCL-associated mutations by performing
      massively parallel sequencing of the whole exome of leukemic and matched
      normal cells purified from the peripheral blood of an index patient with
      HCL. Findings were validated by Sanger sequencing in 47 additional
      patients with HCL. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing identified five
      missense somatic clonal mutations that were confirmed on Sanger
      sequencing, including a heterozygous mutation in BRAF that results in the
      BRAF V600E variant protein. Since BRAF V600E is oncogenic in other
      tumors, further analyses were focused on this genetic lesion. The same
      BRAF mutation was noted in all the other 47 patients with HCL who were
      evaluated by means of Sanger sequencing. None of the 195 patients with
      other peripheral B-cell lymphomas or leukemias who were evaluated carried
      the BRAF V600E variant, including 38 patients with splenic marginal-zone
      lymphomas or unclassifiable splenic lymphomas or leukemias. In
      immunohistologic and Western blot studies, HCL cells expressed
      phosphorylated MEK and ERK (the downstream targets of the BRAF kinase),
      indicating a constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated
      protein kinase pathway in HCL. In vitro incubation of BRAF-mutated
      primary leukemic hairy cells from 5 patients with PLX-4720, a specific
      inhibitor of active BRAF, led to a marked decrease in phosphorylated ERK
      and MEK. CONCLUSIONS; The BRAF V600E mutation was present in all patients
      with HCL who were evaluated. This finding may have implications for the
      pathogenesis, diagnosis, and targeted therapy of HCL. (Funded by

TI  - Network analysis of global influenza spread.
PG  - e1001005
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001005 [doi]
AB  - Although vaccines pose the best means of preventing influenza infection,
      strain selection and optimal implementation remain difficult due to
      antigenic drift and a lack of understanding global spread. Detecting
      viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic
      and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic
      method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering
      and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process.
      Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of
      new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed
      transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread
      from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the
      origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region
      where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the
      virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis
      of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of
      influenza.

TI  - Signs of the 2009 influenza pandemic in the New York-Presbyterian
      Hospital electronic health records.
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0012658 [doi]
LID - e12658 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In June of 2009, the World Health Organization declared the
      first influenza pandemic of the 21(st) century, and by July, New York
      City's New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) experienced a heavy burden
      of cases, attributable to a novel strain of the virus (H1N1pdm). METHODS
      AND RESULTS: We present the signs in the NYPH electronic health records
      (EHR) that distinguished the 2009 pandemic from previous seasonal
      influenza outbreaks via various statistical analyses. These signs include
      (1) an increase in the number of patients diagnosed with influenza, (2) a
      preponderance of influenza diagnoses outside of the normal flu season,
      and (3) marked vaccine failure. The NYPH EHR also reveals distinct age
      distributions of patients affected by seasonal influenza and the pandemic
      strain, and via available longitudinal data, suggests that the two may be
      associated with distinct sets of comorbid conditions as well. In
      particular, we find significantly more pandemic flu patients with
      diagnoses associated with asthma and underlying lung disease. We further
      observe that the NYPH EHR is capable of tracking diseases at a resolution
      as high as particular zip codes in New York City. CONCLUSION: The NYPH
      EHR permits early detection of pandemic influenza and hypothesis
      generation via identification of those significantly associated
      illnesses. As data standards develop and databases expand, EHRs will
      contribute more and more to disease detection and the discovery of novel
      disease associations.

TI  - Spatial simulations of myxobacterial development.
PG  - e1000686
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000686 [doi]
AB  - Many bacteria exhibit multicellular behaviour, with individuals within a
      colony coordinating their actions for communal benefit. One example of
      complex multicellular phenotypes is myxobacterial fruiting body
      formation, where thousands of cells aggregate into large three-
      dimensional structures, within which sporulation occurs. Here we describe
      a novel theoretical model, which uses Monte Carlo dynamics to simulate
      and explain multicellular development. The model captures multiple
      behaviours observed during fruiting, including the spontaneous formation
      of aggregation centres and the formation and dissolution of fruiting
      bodies. We show that a small number of physical properties in the model
      is sufficient to explain the most frequently documented population-level
      behaviours observed during development in Myxococcus xanthus.

TI  - Phosphate acquisition components of the Myxococcus xanthus Pho regulon
      are regulated by both phosphate availability and development.
PG  - 1997-2003
LID - 10.1128/JB.01781-07 [doi]
AB  - In many organisms, phosphatase expression and phosphate (P) uptake are
      coordinately regulated by the Pho regulon. In Myxococcus xanthus P
      limitation initiates multicellular development, a process associated with
      changes in phosphatase expression. We sought here to characterize the
      link between P acquisition and development in this bacterium, an organism
      capable of preying upon other microorganisms as a sole nutrient source.
      M. xanthus seems to possess no significant internal P stores, as reducing
      the P concentration to less than 10 microM retarded growth within one
      doubling time. Pyrophosphate, polyphosphate, and
      glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate could support growth as sole P sources,
      although many other P-containing biomolecules could not (including
      nucleic acids and phospholipids). Several Pho regulon promoters were
      found to be highly active during vegetative growth, and P limitation
      specifically induced pstSCAB, AcPA1, and pho3 promoter activity and
      repressed pit expression. Enhanced pstSCAB and pho3 promoter activities
      in a phoP4 mutant (in the presence of high and low concentrations of P)
      suggested that PhoP4 acts as a repressor of these genes. However, in a
      phoP4 background, the activities of pstSCAB remained P regulated,
      suggesting that there is additional regulation by a P-sensitive factor.
      Initiation of multicellular development caused immediate down-regulation
      of Pho regulon genes and caused pstSCAB and pho3 promoter activities to
      become P insensitive. Hence, P acquisition components of the M. xanthus
      Pho regulon are regulated by both P availability and development, with
      developmental down-regulation overriding up-regulation by P limitation.
      These observations suggest that when development is initiated, subsequent
      changes in P availability become irrelevant to the population, which
      presumably has sufficient intrinsic P to ensure completion of the
      developmental program.
