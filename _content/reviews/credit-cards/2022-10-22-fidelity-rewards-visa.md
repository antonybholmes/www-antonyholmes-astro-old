Fidelity's credit card is a solid 2% cash back card that works exactly as expected.

<!-- end -->

My daily card for many years. It does require a Fidelity account for best use, but since I use Fidelity as a one-stop shop, it made sense for me to also use their credit card. Once it is setup, cashback is automatically deposited into my Fidelity account.

It doesn't seem to get much advertising so I don't think a lot of people are aware of it.

_Do you have a Fidelity credit card? What were your experiences?_
