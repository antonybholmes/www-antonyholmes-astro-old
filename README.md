# www-antonyholmes-astro

My personal site using Astro and mix of Svelte and React components, mostly as test bed of ideas.

The dev branch is sometimes slightly ahead of the main branch, but either dev or main should build a working version of the site.

The main branch is the deployed version you'll see at wwww.antonyholmes.com
