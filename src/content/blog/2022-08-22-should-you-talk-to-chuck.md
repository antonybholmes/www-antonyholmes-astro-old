Schwab is a great one-stop-shop for all your banking and investing needs. Let's see why.

# Investing

Schwab lets you buy basically any stock and ETF available, certainly all of the key total stock and total bonds you should be [using](/blog/2021-12-09-the-vanilla-investor) in your portfolio.

It's just a pity you can't buy fractional shares except for some stocks in the S&P 500, which seems like an artificial limit to me. Fidelity offers fractional shares on pretty much everything, so why can't Schwab?

# Banking

Schwab has a banking division that offers a checking account that with a debit card and is functionally equialent to a checking account.

I'm surprised more people don't use it and instead stick with tranditional banks like Chase or Bank of America.

It offers amongst other things:

- Free debit card
- Free ATM withdrawls worldwide from any ATM so you don't have to worry about going out of network
- Free transfers between accounts at other institutions.
- Early deposit of direct deposits. Get your paycheck a day early.

# Credit Card

Schwab offers an unlimited 1.5% cash back credit card through American Express. It's a fine card, but doesn't offer much over a normal American Express card. They also offer a branded version of the Platinum American Express card, but it has the mostly the same fees and rewards structure as the regular Platinum card.
