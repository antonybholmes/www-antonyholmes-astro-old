Mint Mobile is a great low cost wireless provider.

<!-- end -->

It operates on the T-Mobile networks and gives discounts if you pay upfront for periods of time ranging from 3 to 12 months with the discount increasing the more time you buy.

I use their 10GB monthly plan for which I paid for the 12 months upfront and with taxes and fees, that works out to around $22 a month in the state of New York so your price will vary a little bit from this depending on where you live.

I think it's a good deal and they throw in services like hotspot for free that the big three carriers normally charge for.

I've never had cause to complain about the cell service nor 4G speeds, so all in all I highly recommend them if you are looking to save money on your wireless plan.
